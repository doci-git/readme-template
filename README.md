# Design

## Colours

The color palette for this project features five colors:  
#010B13 - this is a very dark blue, almost black color  
#F9F4FB - this is a very light pinkish-white color  
#FAB1DC - this is a light pink color often associated with breast cancer awareness  
#FF7900 - this is a bright orange color  
#8129C1 - this is a bright purple color, often associated with pancreatic cancer awareness  
The background of the site is set to light-pinkish, creating a calm and clean atmosphere. The navbar uses light pink, which is the color commonly associated with breast cancer awareness. The color bright orange is used to emphasize important words or keywords on the site. Bright purple is another color that is used for emphasis,mostly buttons, and is often associated with all types of cancer. Lastly, dark blue is used for text to provide a good contrast against the background and improve readability. Overall, the color palette is designed to create a visually appealing and informative experience for users.

For the body text, Merriweather is used, a font that enhances readability and provides a comfortable reading experience. As a backup fonts are used Sans-Serif and Serif. Together, these fonts create a professional and visually pleasing design that aligns with the web app's mission of raising awareness about cancer.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
